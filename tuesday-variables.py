#module 1 - variables
#variables are bit like excel cells. similar concept in python.
#in python, each variable has a name and a value.

#below we define a variable named 'greeting'
greeting = 'Hello, friend!'

#now, we can perform functions using that variable
print(greeting)

#we did not put apostrophes around the word 'greeting' because it would print the word 'greeting'
print('greeting')

greeting = 'Hi, everybody'
print(greeting)

#variable exists when you first assign a value to it. 
#must assign a value to a variable before using it in a function.
new_greeting = 'Cheers!'
print(new_greeting)

#rules for defining variables are:
#variable names must start with a letter or the underscore sign
#upper and lower letters are treated differently
#a couple of keywords cannot be used as variable names such as: from, global

test_variable_name = 'varible naming rules'
